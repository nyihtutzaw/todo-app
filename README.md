# Todo React App

  

## Overview

  

This is a React app for managing TODOs. It uses Vite for the development server and build process, TypeScript for static typing, ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting, Husky for Git hooks, and Jest for testing.

  

## Prerequisites

  

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

  

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

  

## Getting Started

  

1.  **Clone the repository:**

  


> git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
> 
> cd your-project

Install Dependencies:

If using npm:

> npm  install

If using Yarn:

> yarn

  

Duplicate  the  .env.example  file  and  rename  it  to  .env  for  local  development.

> cp  .env.example  .env
> 
Create  a  separate  .env.production  file  for  production  settings.
> 
> cp  .env.example  .env.production

Update  the  values  in  .env  and  .env.production  accordingly.


Development:
Start  the  development  server:

> npm  run  dev

Visit  http://localhost:3000  in  your  browser.

  

Production  Build:

To  build  for  production:

bash

> npm  run  build:prod

This  will  create  a  dist  folder  with  optimized  production-ready  files.

Scripts

 Start  the  development  server.
> npm  run  dev


Build  the  app  for  production.
> npm  run  build


 ESLint  for  code  linting.
> npm  run  lint


Run  Prettier  to  format  code.
> npm  run  format


 Run  Jest  for  testing.

> npm  run  test

Git  Hook

This  project  uses  Husky  to  enforce  pre-commit  hooks  for  linting  and  formatting.  Ensure  that  you  have  the  required  dependencies  installed  by  running:

> npm  run  prepare

Notes

Adjust  ESLint  and  Prettier  configurations  in  .eslintrc.js  and  .prettierrc  respectively.

Customize  Jest  configurations  in  jest.config.js.

Update  Vite  configurations  in  vite.config.js.

Add  specific  instructions  or  notes  relevant  to  your  project.

Feel  free  to  customize  this  template  based  on  the  structure  and  specific  details  of  your  project.  It  provides  a  basic  guide  for  setting  up  and  running  the  app  in  both  development  and  production  environments.
